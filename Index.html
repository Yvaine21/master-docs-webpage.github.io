<p> Judge Daniel Kubasiak of Cook County Circuit Court issued a temporary restraining order Friday afternoon on the county’s sweetened beverage tax, which was scheduled to go into effect on Saturday.</p>

<p>The penny-per-ounce tax will be applied to all sweetened non-alcoholic beverages sold by retail stores in Cook County, regardless the type of sweetener used.</p>

<p>“I would definitely choose something else, something sugarless for many reasons, for health reasons.” says Zerina Micov, who was putting a case of Coca-Cola into her shopping cart at Aldi, a discount grocery store.</p>

<p>Whether a beverage tax will have health benefits at a societal scale remains uncertain.</p>

<p>“People are still probably gonna buy It,” said Sarah Lawrence, a Whole Foods Market customer standing in front of the beverage fridge. “People who are drinking pops don't really care about sugar.”</p>

<p>Ben Paulsen, another customer at Whole Foods Market also expressed his doubt: “You put a tax on the soda, [people] will drink sugary juices instead. Apple juice has like 60 grams of sugar!”
</p>


<p>Since the approval of the beverage tax in November 2016, opposing voices have been raised among retailers and consumers. The temporary restraining order was granted as a result of a lawsuit filed by Illinois retailers, according to the Chicago Tribune. </p>

<p>“I actually had a customer this afternoon asking about [the tax],” said Alejandra Zaragoza, a floor manager at Aldi. “Customers are complaining, but in terms of [whether they will reduce] consumption, I’m not sure. But probably not.”
</p>

<p>President Preckwinkle responded immediately to the suspension of the beverage tax implementation. She wrote in a press statement the Board will appeal the judge’s ruling before the Appellate Court.</p>
